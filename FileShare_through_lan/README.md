# FileShare_through_Lan
	This has two scripts basically one the sender runs and one the receiver runs.
	The sender first runs the script, enters a port, waits for some reciever.
	Receiver then asks for ip addressof sender and the port number.
	A connection will be established then.
	Sender then types in the path of the file name including the filename 
	That's it the file gets transfered
